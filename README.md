## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is an information management and analysis tool used by businesses and organizations to manage their interactions with customers. CRM systems collect and store customer data, allowing for advanced analysis such as customer segmentation, contact history, and marketing campaign optimization. This notebook aims to demonstrate how CRM systems can be leveraged to analyze customer data and increase revenue through targeted marketing strategies.

## Customer Relationship Management (CRM) <a id="crm"></a>

CRM refers to the process by which a business or organization manages its interactions with customers. It involves the use of data analysis to study and understand customer behavior, preferences, and needs. CRM analytics focuses on various aspects of customer management, including customer lifecycle optimization, internal and external communications, customer acquisition and retention, cross-selling and up-selling, and customer segmentation studies.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a id="kpis"></a>

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are performance measurements that assess the success of an organization or specific activities. In the context of CRM analytics, some important KPIs include:

- Customer Acquisition Rate: Measures the rate at which new customers are acquired.
- Customer Retention Rate: Measures the rate at which existing customers are retained.
- Customer Churn Rate: Measures the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company.
- Conversion Rate: Measures the rate at which potential customers are converted into paying customers.

## Cohort Analysis <a id="cohort-analysis"></a>

Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics that involves grouping data into comparable cohorts based on specific characteristics or events over a defined time period. In the context of CRM, cohort analysis helps identify patterns and trends in customer behavior throughout their lifecycle. By analyzing cohorts of customers with similar characteristics, businesses can gain insights into customer retention, engagement, and overall performance.

## Business Problem <a id="business-problem"></a>

The business problem addressed in this notebook is related to customer segmentation and marketing strategy optimization. An e-commerce company aims to segment its customers and develop targeted marketing campaigns. The goal is to identify and target new customers differently from high-value and profitable customers in order to maximize revenue and customer retention.

## Dataset <a id="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project contains sales data from an e-commerce company between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The analysis primarily focuses on the years 2010-2011. The company specializes in selling souvenirs, and a significant portion of its customers consists of corporate clients.
